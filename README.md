A full-stack starter template featuring **Nextjs & Hardhat or Foundry**, designed for building `Dapps`, as well as developing, deploying, testing, and verifying Solidity smart contracts on the Open Campus L3 chain. This starter kit includes pre-installed packages such as `create-next-app`, `hardhat`, `foundry`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn-ui`, `web3.js`, `ocid`, and more.

## üì∫ Quickstart | Nextjs & Hardhat

**You will find the Nextjs & Foundry implementation [Here](https://github.com/AsharibAli/create-edu-dapp-foundry).**

### ‚åõÔ∏è create-edu-dapp command

Open up your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command:

```sh
npx create-edu-dapp <your-dapp-name>

# cd into the directory
cd <your-dapp-name>
```

***Note: If you have used the npx command then you don't have to install manually in any directory.***

### üìú Smart Contracts

All smart contracts are located inside the `backend` aka `hardhat` folder, which can be found in the root directory. To get started, first install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
# change directory into the backend folder
cd backend

npm install
```

### üîë Private key

Ensure you create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Then paste your [Metamask private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) in `.env` with the variable name `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` as follows:

```sh
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x734...
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compile

Now, you can write your contracts in `./contracts/` directory, replace `Greeter.sol` with `<your-contracts>.sol` file.

```sh
# For compiling the smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

After successful compilation, the artifacts directory will be created in `./src` with a JSON `/contracts/<your-contracts>.sol/<your-contracts>.json` containing ABI and Bytecode of your compiled smart contracts.

### üß™ Test

To write tests, go to `./test` directory and create `<your-contracts>.ts`, you can test your smart contracts using the following command.

```sh
# For testing the smart contracts
npx hardhat test
```


### ‚õìÔ∏è Deploy

Before deploying the smart contracts, ensure that you have added the [`Open Campus Codex`](https://open-campus-docs.vercel.app/getting-started) to your MetaMask wallet and that it has sufficient funds. If you do not have testnet $EDU on Open Campus Codex, please follow this [faucets guide](https://open-campus-docs.vercel.app/build/faucet).

Also, make changes in `./scripts/deploy.ts` (replace the greeter contract name with `<your-contract-name>`).

For deploying the smart contracts to `open campus codex` network, type the following command:

```sh
# For deloying the smart contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network opencampus
```

```sh
<your-contract> deployed to: 0x...
```

## **Copy and paste the generated contract JSON ABI folder `contracts` inside the `backend/src/contracts` directory to the `/frontend/` directory.**

## **Copy and paste the deployed contract address [here](https://github.com/AsharibAli/create-edu-dapp-hardhat/blob/9783589c2d7b66de4457a15f30f9e8e86a39d02a/frontend/app/page.tsx#L53).**

### ‚úÖ Verify

To verify the deployed smart contract on `Open Campus Codex`, execute the following command:

```sh
# For verifying the smart contracts
npx hardhat verify --network opencampus <deployed-contract-address>
```

### üíª Next.js client

Start the Next.js app by running the following command in the `frontend` directory:

```sh
# Change directory into the frontend folder 
cd frontend

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
